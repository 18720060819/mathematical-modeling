\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What's this all about? What's \LaTeX?}
Due to the sea level rise and land degradation caused by global climate change, tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of people will be forced to leave their homes where their forefathers lived and head for strange areas in recent years or in the foreseeable future. For example, Tuvalu, an island country in the Pacific Ocean, began its national migration several years ago. Besides, reports such as “Maldives is sinking to the bottom of the sea” are accustomed. With the reality factors interwoven with media rendering, the term "environmental refugee" is not too strange to us today.


In the academic and political circles, the discussion about environmental refugees is getting more and more intense. On the one hand, for environmental refugees themselves, the concept of environmental refugees is different from that of refugees in the traditional sense, so most of the policies and documents issued by the world organization cannot be effectively applied to this group, which brings certain challenges to the survival of environmental refugees and the protection of basic human rights. On the other hand, from the perspective of national machinery and international organizations, it is very likely that millions of people will migrate across national borders in this century, which is possible to lead to the growth of conflicts among civilizations and produce negative effects on international peace. Based on these considerations, people from all walks of life generally believe that programs and policies that are more in line with the current situation of environmental refugee migration should be put forward as soon as possible to achieve the ultimate goal of stabilizing the international order and harmonious global development.


However, it is not easy to find feasible and acceptable programs and policies. Environmental refugees will bring a multi-subject international problem. The wishes of both the migrating refugees themselves and the countries responsible for receiving cannot be ignored. Unlike ordinary refugees, environmental refugees are doomed to never return to their homes from the moment they make the difficult decision to leave their homes. There is no hometown behind them, only the tolerance and love of the earth as an organic whole.

\item \textbf{Applies widely}\\
This  system can be used for many types of airplanes, and it also solves the interference during  the procedure of the boarding
airplane,as described above we can get to the  optimization
boarding time.We also know that all the service is automate.
\item \textbf{Improve the quality of the airport service}\\
Balancing the cost of the cost and the benefit, it will bring in
more convenient  for airport and passengers.It also saves many
human resources for the airline. \item \textbf{}

\section{First appendix}

In addition, your report must include a letter to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Goodgrant Foundation, Mr. Alpha Chiang, that describes the optimal investment strategy, your modeling approach and major results, and a brief discussion of your proposed concept of a return-on-investment (ROI). This letter should be no more than two pages in length.
